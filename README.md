# Elixir Prelude
This package has a set of functions that I extracted from projects I worked on (mainly [this](https://github.com/houshuang/survey)). Some are very trivial, others (especially in the Prelude.Map module) are more involved. I am mainly putting it together for my own future reuse, but some of it might be useful to others. I would like to add tests, and I will keep adding functions as they come up. Pull requests or suggestions for new functions, better APIs etc are welcome (tests would be awesome).
